# Soberbrite

Soberbrite is a social networking site for people with substance abuse issues that connects sober people and those looking to get sober. Users can find one another based on the recovery center they attended or their relative distance. Users can also create formal and informal meetings or find established meetings from recovery programs like [Alcoholics Anonymous](https://www.aa.org) or [SMART Recovery](https://www.smartrecovery.org).
